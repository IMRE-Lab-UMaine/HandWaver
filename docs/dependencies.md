### LeapMotion App Modules by [LeapMotion](https://github.com/leapmotion/AppExperiments)

[Package Download](https://github.com/maine-imre/LM-AppExperiments/releases)  *

Free and Open-Source. Used as a main control interface. (Essential to function).  This asset requires some modification in order for it to compile.  We hope to document this process (or include a copy of  the source) in the future.

*The package download is from a fork of LeapMotion's origional repository, that we have modified to ensure compatability with our repository.

***The package is temporarily a derivative of [LeapPaint](https://github.com/maine-imre/Paint/releases)***

### Photon PUN2 by [Exit Games](https://www.photonengine.com/en/pun)

[Package Download](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922)

Paid Asset. Used to add multiplayer support. (Essential to function)  This is only used in the dodgeball scene, but the repository will not compile without this.  Buildflags will be used in the future to avoid this.
