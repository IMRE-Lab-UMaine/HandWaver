# Mathematical Audit of Algorithms for Scale and Dimension Scene

In this document, we describe the methods we use (and their sources) for computing the dynamic figures described in the scale and dimension scene.  We acknolwedge that the cases presented here may be limited in nature.  While this scene was being developed a team was working to integrate with a server-side implementation of GeoGebra.  Any generalized version would use the GGB implementation to do the heavy lifting.

### Intersection of a plane and a circle

Consider a circle $C$ in a plane orthagonal to $(0,1,0)$ and and a plane orthagonal to $(0,0,1)$.
Let $R$ be the radius of the circle.
Let $\rho$ be the signed distance between the center of the circle and the line $L$ formed by the intersection of the plane and the circle's plane.
Let $2x$ be the distance between the points formed by the intersection of the circle and the line $L$.
Since there is reflective symmetry in any direction on the circle, the points lie $\plusminus x$ in the direction of $L$ from the center of the circle.
By the pythagorean theorem we have $$(x)^2 + \rho^2 = R^2$$

  So the points lie at $(\plusminus \sqrt{R^2 - \rho^2},0,\rho)$.  If $\rho = R$, the two values are equal and there is only one point formed by the intersection of $C$ and $L$.  If $\rho > R$, then there is no intersection.
