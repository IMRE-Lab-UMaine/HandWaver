HandWaver is an application built for the HTC Vive and LeapMotion controllers that allows students to construct and manipulate these figures in a virtual 3-dimensional space, with special attention to operations that increase the dimension of the figure (i.e. point-to-line, line-to-plane, plane-to-prism).  HandWaver is a project of the Immersive Mathematics in Rendered Environments (IMRE) Lab at the College of Education and Human Development at University of Maine. IMRE is directed by Dr. Justin Dimmel.

 
STRETCH OPERATOR: Pull a point into a line, line into a plane

The stretch operator can be used to create 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional polygons.  The operator uses a 'pull' gesture with two hands to increase the dimension of the figure, and allows the user to use a single hand to manipulate the points, lines, and planes.

REVOLVE OPERATOR:
Construct arcs, circles, surfaces

The revolve operator continues to associate increasing the dimension of a figure with the 'pull' gesture, revolving the selected figure around the user.


SLICE OPERATOR:
View a cross section of a figure

The slice operator allows the user to view a cross section, using a plane that intersects the figure, with the ability to move the plane and view cross sections at different elevations and angles.  This function extends the use of HandWaver into algebra and pre-calculus classrooms.

The slice operator also allows the user to split a figure into two or more sub-figures, and then continue with constructions and manipulations of those figures.


RELATIONSHIP OPERATOR:
Define congruance, parallel and perpendicular

The relationship operator allows the user to assign sets of lines, angles, surfaces or solids to be congruent, parallel or perpendicular.

The relationship operator also displays measures of angle, length, area and volume for selected sub-figures.

HOIST Operator: a more precise version of REVOLVE, hoist allows a user to "unfurl" segments into angles by holding the end of a segment with one hand and using the other hand to turn (in a motion like hoisting a sail by turning a crank) with another. Turning clockwise/counter clockwise would affect which way segment unfurls. By default, angle would be defined in a plane that is perpendicular to the floor (through the segment). Angle of plane could be adjusted after the fact. 

GEO MODE/TRACE MODE: GEO MODE is what we are working on now; as a complement, we should have a trace mode, where a user could create free curves by dragging points through space (and the trail of the point would be the curve); free surfaces by dragging segments through space (you could use this mode to create a shape like a mobius strip); and free solids by dragging solids through space. 

GAZE/HOVER operator: Have some mode that would let me explore a surface as if I was in a hovercraft, where I could use the angle of my gaze with the surface to control the speed at which I am flying over it...I am really thinking of this as like a dynamic zoom/explore mode users could control with head position

DESIGN: I think it would be cool if the world itself were situated in the interior of a Platonic solid, perhaps an Icosahedron. I am imaging something with bright, even light and real clean aesthetic. You could look up and see the vertices of the solid you are in (we would be like near its equator)...a geodesic dome look could work well...I think the VR demo experience (where you should the balloons) has a nice look and feel to it....convey a real sense of space

VIRTUAL BLACKBOARD: A glass panel, floating in one part of the room (but in a plane perpendicular to the floor), where one could do everything that can be done in the 3-space version of handwaver, but just confined to a 2-d plane. It would be nice if it would be possible to take 2-D objects that were made on the virtual board and pull them out into space (like blowing a bubble with a wire frame). Note: you could imagine future mathematics classrooms where the teacher is using the virtual white board like an actual whiteboard (with haptic feedback to make it feel like you were pressing on something). 

HIGHER DIMENSIONS: This is more of a question for us: How can we use the affordances of VR to make new representations of higher dimensional objects? Is it any easier to wrap one's mind around a 4D object being project into a 3D space if you are in the space and there is a way to, indirectly, act on the 4D object?

MEASUREMENT TOOLS (see email from September 10, 2016): We had discussed various virtual measurement tools, such as a caliper for measuring lengths (or also a virtual trundle wheel, which would tie in with the paint roller idea), a paint roller (with different kinds of "heads", like square or rectangular or triangle, in addition to the standard paint roller) for area, and a paint bucket for volume. You also suggested the melt/pour volume comparison tool. 

INTEGRATION TOOLS: Here is a heading where the explode operator you are working on would fit. We could have an analogous tool for area, where you have "slices" of 2d shapes of various thickness that could eventually get as thin as possible.
